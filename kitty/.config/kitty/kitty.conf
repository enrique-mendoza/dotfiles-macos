#: Cursor customization {{{

#: Default cursor color. If set to the special value none the cursor
#: will be rendered with a "reverse video" effect. It's color will be
#: the color of the text in the cell it is over and the text will be
#: rendered with the background color of the cell. Note that if the
#: program running in the terminal sets a cursor color, this takes
#: precedence. Also, the cursor colors are modified if the cell
#: background and foreground colors have very low contrast.

cursor #c0caf5

#: The color of text under the cursor. If you want it rendered with
#: the background color of the cell underneath instead, use the
#: special keyword: background. Note that if cursor is set to none
#: then this option is ignored.

cursor_text_color #1a1b26

#: The cursor shape can be one of block, beam, underline. Note that
#: when reloading the config this will be changed only if the cursor
#: shape has not been set by the program running in the terminal. This
#: sets the default cursor shape, applications running in the terminal
#: can override it. In particular, shell integration
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/> in kitty sets
#: the cursor shape to beam at shell prompts. You can avoid this by
#: setting shell_integration to no-cursor.

cursor_shape block

#: The interval to blink the cursor (in seconds). Set to zero to
#: disable blinking. Negative values mean use system default. Note
#: that the minimum interval will be limited to repaint_delay.

cursor_blink_interval 0

#: Mouse {{{

#: Hide mouse cursor after the specified number of seconds of the
#: mouse not being used. Set to zero to disable mouse cursor hiding.
#: Set to a negative value to hide the mouse cursor immediately when
#: typing text. Disabled by default on macOS as getting it to work
#: robustly with the ever-changing sea of bugs that is Cocoa is too
#: much effort.

mouse_hide_wait -1.0

#: The color and style for highlighting URLs on mouse-over. url_style
#: can be one of: none, straight, double, curly, dotted, dashed.

url_color #0087bd
# url_style curly

#: }}}

#: Window layout {{{

#: The width of window borders. Can be either in pixels (px) or pts
#: (pt). Values in pts will be rounded to the nearest number of pixels
#: based on screen resolution. If not specified, the unit is assumed
#: to be pts. Note that borders are displayed only when more than one
#: window is visible. They are meant to separate multiple windows.

window_border_width 1

#: The window margin (in pts) (blank area outside the border). A
#: single value sets all four sides. Two values set the vertical and
#: horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal and bottom. Four
#: values set top, right, bottom and left.

window_margin_width 6

#: The window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the
#: window border). A single value sets all four sides. Two values set
#: the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal
#: and bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.

#: Tab bar {{{

#: The edge to show the tab bar on, top or bottom.

tab_bar_edge top

#: The tab bar style, can be one of:

#: fade
#:     Each tab's edges fade into the background color. (See also tab_fade)
#: slant
#:     Tabs look like the tabs in a physical file.
#: separator
#:     Tabs are separated by a configurable separator. (See also
#:     tab_separator)
#: powerline
#:     Tabs are shown as a continuous line with "fancy" separators.
#:     (See also tab_powerline_style)
#: custom
#:     A user-supplied Python function called draw_tab is loaded from the file
#:     tab_bar.py in the kitty config directory. For examples of how to
#:     write such a function, see the functions named draw_tab_with_* in
#:     kitty's source code: kitty/tab_bar.py. See also
#:     this discussion <https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/discussions/4447>
#:     for examples from kitty users.
#: hidden
#:     The tab bar is hidden. If you use this, you might want to create a mapping
#:     for the select_tab action which presents you with a list of tabs and
#:     allows for easy switching to a tab.

tab_bar_style fade

#: Control how each tab fades into the background when using fade for
#: the tab_bar_style. Each number is an alpha (between zero and one)
#: that controls how much the corresponding cell fades into the
#: background, with zero being no fade and one being full fade. You
#: can change the number of cells used by adding/removing entries to
#: this list.

#: Color scheme {{{

#: The foreground and background colors.

foreground #c0caf5
background #1a1b26

#: The opacity of the background. A number between zero and one, where
#: one is opaque and zero is fully transparent. This will only work if
#: supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
#: X11). Note that it only sets the background color's opacity in
#: cells that have the same background color as the default terminal
#: background, so that things like the status bar in vim, powerline
#: prompts, etc. still look good. But it means that if you use a color
#: theme with a background color in your editor, it will not be
#: rendered as transparent. Instead you should change the default
#: background color in your kitty config and not use a background
#: color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape codes to set
#: the terminals default colors in a shell script to launch your
#: editor. Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a (possibly
#: significant) performance hit. If you want to dynamically change
#: transparency of windows, set dynamic_background_opacity to yes
#: (this is off by default as it has a performance cost). Changing
#: this option when reloading the config will only work if
#: dynamic_background_opacity was enabled in the original config.

background_opacity 1.0

#: The foreground and background colors for text selected with the
#: mouse. Setting both of these to none will cause a "reverse video"
#: effect for selections, where the selection will be the cell text
#: color and the text will become the cell background color. Setting
#: only selection_foreground to none will cause the foreground color
#: to be used unchanged. Note that these colors can be overridden by
#: the program running in the terminal.

selection_foreground #c0caf5
selection_background #33467c

#: The color table {{{
#: The 256 terminal colors. There are 8 basic colors, each color has a
#: dull and bright version, for the first 16 colors. You can set the

#: Advanced {{{

#: The interval to periodically check if an update to kitty is
#: available (in hours). If an update is found, a system notification
#: is displayed informing you of the available update. The default is
#: to check every 24 hours, set to zero to disable. Update checking is
#: only done by the official binary builds. Distro packages or source
#: builds do not do update checking. Changing this option by reloading
#: the config is not supported.

update_check_interval 0

#: Enable shell integration on supported shells. This enables features
#: such as jumping to previous prompts, browsing the output of the
#: previous command in a pager, etc. on supported shells. Set to
#: disabled to turn off shell integration, completely. It is also
#: possible to disable individual features, set to a space separated
#: list of these values: no-rc, no-cursor, no-title, no-cwd, no-
#: prompt-mark, no-complete. See Shell integration
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/> for details.

shell_integration no-cursor

#: }}}

#: OS specific tweaks {{{

#: The color of the kitty window's titlebar on macOS. A value of
#: system means to use the default system color, light or dark can
#: also be used to set it explicitly. A value of background means to
#: use the background color of the currently active window and finally
#: you can use an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or red. WARNING:
#: This option works by using a hack when arbitrary color (or
#: background) is configured, as there is no proper Cocoa API for it.
#: It sets the background color of the entire window and makes the
#: titlebar transparent. As such it is incompatible with
#: background_opacity. If you want to use both, you are probably
#: better off just hiding the titlebar with hide_window_decorations.

macos_titlebar_color system

#: Use the Option key as an Alt key on macOS. With this set to no,
#: kitty will use the macOS native Option+Key to enter Unicode
#: character behavior. This will break any Alt+Key keyboard shortcuts
#: in your terminal programs, but you can use the macOS Unicode input
#: technique. You can use the values: left, right or both to use only
#: the left, right or both Option keys as Alt, instead. Note that
#: kitty itself always treats Option the same as Alt. This means you
#: cannot use this option to configure different kitty shortcuts for
#: Option+Key vs. Alt+Key. Also, any kitty shortcuts using
#: Option/Alt+Key will take priority, so that any such key presses
#: will not be passed to terminal programs running inside kitty.
#: Changing this option by reloading the config is not supported.

macos_option_as_alt no

#: Choose between Wayland and X11 backends. By default, an appropriate
#: backend based on the system state is chosen automatically. Set it
#: to x11 or wayland to force the choice. Changing this option by
#: reloading the config is not supported.

linux_display_server auto

#: }}}

#: Keyboard shortcuts {{{

#: Keys are identified simply by their lowercase Unicode characters.
#: For example: a for the A key, [ for the left square bracket key,
#: etc. For functional keys, such as Enter or Escape, the names are
#: present at Functional key definitions
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/#functional>.
#: For modifier keys, the names are ctrl (control, ⌃), shift (⇧), alt
#: (opt, option, ⌥), super (cmd, command, ⌘). See also: GLFW mods
#: <https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__mods.html>

#: On Linux you can also use XKB key names to bind keys that are not
#: supported by GLFW. See XKB keys
#: <https://github.com/xkbcommon/libxkbcommon/blob/master/include/xkbcommon/xkbcommon-
#: keysyms.h> for a list of key names. The name to use is the part
#: after the XKB_KEY_ prefix. Note that you can only use an XKB key
#: name for keys that are not known as GLFW keys.

#: Finally, you can use raw system key codes to map keys, again only
#: for keys that are not known as GLFW keys. To see the system key
#: code for a key, start kitty with the kitty --debug-input option,
#: kitty will output some debug text for every key event. In that text
#: look for native_code, the value of that becomes the key name in the
#: shortcut. For example:

#: .. code-block:: none

#:     on_key_input: glfw key: 0x61 native_code: 0x61 action: PRESS mods: none text: 'a'

#: Here, the key name for the A key is 0x61 and you can use it with::

#:     map ctrl+0x61 something

#: to map Ctrl+A to something.

#: You can use the special action no_op to unmap a keyboard shortcut
#: that is assigned in the default configuration::

#:     map kitty_mod+space no_op

#: If you would like kitty to completely ignore a key event, not even
#: sending it to the program running in the terminal, map it to
#: discard_event::

#:     map kitty_mod+f1 discard_event

#: You can combine multiple actions to be triggered by a single
#: shortcut with combine action, using the syntax below::

#:     map key combine <separator> action1 <separator> action2 <separator> action3 ...

#: For example::

#:     map kitty_mod+e combine : new_window : next_layout

#: This will create a new window and switch to the next available
#: layout.

#: You can use multi-key shortcuts with the syntax shown below::

#:     map key1>key2>key3 action

#: For example::

#:     map ctrl+f>2 set_font_size 20

#: The full list of actions that can be mapped to key presses is
#: available here <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/actions/>.

# Shift + Enter
map shift+enter send_text all \x1b[13;2u

# Ctrl + I Remaps
map ctrl+i send_text all \x1b[105;5u
